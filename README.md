A dedicated repository for my data-science and analytics' work on the **_novel Coronavirus_**, that came into action during late 2019 <br />

This project mainly works onto the Confirmed & Deaths cases.

## novel Coronavirus Disease: 2020 
<br /> 

In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, novel **Co**rona**vi**rus **D**isease (COVID-19) has appeared as the most severe pandemic, originated from **Hubei** province of China.<br /><br /> 
    Caused by: **novel Coronavirus - 2**
    


<br />



### Story of its origin  - 
> During November, 2019 - a severe viral infection was noticed in **Wuhan**, a city in Hubei provinces of China. On November 17<sup>th</sup> 2019, the first case this infection was reported. Doctor's initially took it lightly as if it was a normal fever/cold. But, when a wide range of patients reported similar symptoms, a doctor - **Dr. Li Wenliang** of Chinese Academy of Sciences (**CAS**) Lab, claimed that it was a type of _severe acute respiratory syndrome_, spreading through a new coronavirus transmission in the whole Hubei province, very rapidly. Reportedly, chainese government warned him not to leak this anywhere. But anyhow, this news got exposed during the late December, 2019. <br /><br />
As per the sources, in 2003, the same lab found first deadly SARS Coronavirus, led to 813 casualties, all over the world, within two months! <br /><br />
Initially, it was named as "Wuhan Virus". But, as it started spreading rapidly from Hubei to the whole mainland of China, its name got replaced by term "China Virus".<br />

<br />



Finally, on **Feb. 11<sup>th</sup> 2020**, the World Health Organization (WHO) gave the disease an official name: **COVID-19**.<br />
WHO has also declared the COVID-19 as a **pandemic**. 
<br /><br /> 

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, over 350000 people have been infected throughout the world and **over 15000 people** have been **killed**.<br /><br />

## How fast it grew since Jan 21<sup>st</sup>, 2020

### About the Disease

The COVID-19 is spread as rapidly as it has the **Reproduction Number** (R-naught) **2.5**.

![R-naught](Main%20Documentation/pics/rnaught.png)

<br /><br />

**Reproduction Number:** is meant for the average number of people, whom an infected person is further infecting. In more generalized language, on an average, from every COVID-19 patient, virus are getting transmitted to at least 2.5 fit persons.<br />
For Ebola, this number is appx. 1.7<br /><br />
In order to have controle on any epidemic, the reproducibility score has to be decreased as much as possible.<br /><br />
That's why, most of the highly countries are locked down. In many of them, there are the shortage of hospitals/beds/doctors, too.<br />
Due to the lockdown, the market is also going down.<br /><br />


<br /> 

### Symptoms: 

<br /> 

The _severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19_ **(SARS-CoV-19)**, which is often termed as 2019-nCoV, as well, is basically a viral disease spread by the novel coronavirus in which the virus tend to attack onto the respiratory system of the patient.<br />

Though the studies are still going on, following are some most common symptoms of COVID-19, known so far:
> 1. Fever
> 2. Dry Cough
> 3. Fatigue
> 4. Shortness of Breath
> 5. Nasal Congestion etc..

These are the symptoms that are reported by most of the patients. Apart from these, few patients also found to develop aches and pains and get the sniffles, according to data from China.
